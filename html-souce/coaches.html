            </p>
            <p>
              After two years of high school track and field I decided to sign my letter of intent with Grand Valley State University. During my college tenure we were 2012 indoor and outdoor National Champion. I became a 3x All American with 6 indoor and Outdoor National meet appearances. 3x time GLAIC 60-meter champion (2013,2014,2015). 1 x GLIAC indoor and outdoor champion in long jump (2013), 2013 GLIAC Indoor triple jump champion and Outdoor runner up, and a host of top 3 finishes at GLIAC.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have coached ages 15 months-high school seniors in all sports, specializing in track and field. I’ve coached at the YMCA of Greater Grand Rapids from 2012-2016 coaching track and field, dance, tumbling, soccer, basketball, and floor hockey. I interned for CANUSA in 2013 while coaching summer track at local elementary schools. I am currently the Head Girls Track and Field Coach at Carman Ainsworth and Chair for CANUSA Track and Field. I am excited to be back home to work with the youth in the city, increasing their mental and physical abilities that they will carry throughout life.
